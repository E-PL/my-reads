# MyReads Project

This project is part of the Udacity [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) and I've used the starting template provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) here: (https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)

## TL;DR

Live version: (https://e-pl.github.io/my-reads/)

To run the project:

* download and unzip the compressed folder or clone the repository
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server

The API server is provided by Udacity

## Note
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## React-router-dom

I have used [react-router-dom](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-dom) by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com/) for routing. 

## gh-pages

I've used [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) to publish it on GitHub Pages

## Contributing

This repository is an exercise for the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegre. 

Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.
